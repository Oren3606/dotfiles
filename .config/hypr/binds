# Bind flags:
#   l -> locked, will also work when an input inhibitor (e.g. a lockscreen) is active.
#   r -> release, will trigger on release of a key.
#   e -> repeat, will repeat when held.
#   n -> non-consuming, key/mouse events will be passed to the active window in addition to triggering the dispatcher.
#   m -> mouse, see below.
#   t -> transparent, cannot be shadowed by other binds.
#   i -> ignore mods, will ignore modifiers.
#   s -> separate, will arbitrarily combine keys between each mod/key, see [Keysym combos](#keysym-combos) above.
#   d -> has description, will allow you to write a description for your bind.
#   p -> bypasses the app's requests to inhibit keybinds.
